          Hello! My name is Alan Zhong, and I'm a passionate software developer
          graduating from UW-Madison. I currently specialize in creating dynamic and responsive web
          applications using React. I am also familiar with Python, C, and Java in the context of machine learning, operating systems, and backend respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a keen interest in exploring machine learning and applying it to my interests in basketball and soccer, and I
          enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love to play the viola in the All University String Orchestra at UW and am also building strength to one 
          one day play soccer again. I'm also an avid learner, always looking to
          expand my knowledge and skills in various areas of technology and seeking philosophical truth in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to connect or learn more
          about my work. I'm always open to new opportunities and
