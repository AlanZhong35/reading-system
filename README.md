This project has evolved from a reading tracker (hence the name) to a machine learning application that predicts a salary for an nba player given certain statistics. To run, cd into backend and run this line in terminal to start the backend server "python app.py". Then, cd into my-app and run "npm run dev". You should now be able to enter statistics, the model can be found on my kaggle notebook here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alantrex35/notebook2a22a63115/edit/run/187284474 .
